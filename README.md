# Auto-Sort-Machine
The Auto Sort Machine is a system that automates the process of sorting objects based on 
specific criteria. It typically uses various technologies such as sensors, motors, and 
microcontrollers to detect, sort, and move objects along a conveyor belt or other types of 
systems. The Auto Sort Machine can be customized to sort objects based on different criteria, 
such as size, weight, shape, and color. It is widely used in manufacturing plants and warehouses 
to increase efficiency, reduce errors, and improve productivity.
In addition to its practical applications, the Auto Sort Machine project aligns with the 
Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 9: Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure. This SDG 
emphasizes the importance of investing in infrastructure, innovation, and research to support 
sustainable industrialization and economic growth. The Auto Sort Machine project is a prime 
example of such innovation, as it aims to improve the efficiency and productivity of industrial 
processes through the use of advanced technologies. By contributing to SDG 9, the Auto Sort 
Machine project also promotes sustainability and economic development
